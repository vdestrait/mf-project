# Group project - Interface3 _WORK-IN-PROGRESS_

## Moules-Frites, l'art belge Ã  la sauce contemporaine

Interface3 is a school for women who want to learn/improve their skills in web developement.

At the beginning of the training course, we were requested to do a group project. The other people in my group left the school, so I am now on my own to take this project to the end.

The website aim to show a timeline of the Belgian contemporary artists, from 1950 until now.

_Still very buggy for the moment and lack of content_
